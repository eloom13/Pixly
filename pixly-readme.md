# Pixly Backend

## üöÄ New in this version

The new version of the Pixly backend brings significant improvements in architecture, performance, and code maintainability:

- **Modular design** - The architecture is divided into three key projects (API, Services, Models) enabling better organization and maintainability
- **Generic CRUD** - We've implemented generic controllers and services that significantly reduce code duplication
- **Consistent API responses** - We've standardized all API responses through the ApiResponse<T> pattern
- **Intelligent image handling** - Enhanced integration with Cloudinary for optimal display of images of different orientations and sizes
- **Advanced filtering and sorting** - More flexible system for searching, filtering, and sorting photo collections

## üèóÔ∏è Project architecture

The project is structured into three main components:

### Pixly.API
The frontend for our application containing controllers and API endpoints. This layer is responsible for receiving HTTP requests, validating input data, and formatting responses.

### Pixly.Services
The middle layer that implements the business logic of the application. It contains services, database interaction, and integration with external services like Cloudinary.

### Pixly.Models
Contains data models, DTOs, and search requests. This project is shared between the API and Services layers and defines the structure of data being exchanged.
